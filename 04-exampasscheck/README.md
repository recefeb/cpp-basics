# Exam Pass Check in C++

This is a simple C++ program that checks whether a student has passed the course based on their score.  
It's typically one of the first programs beginners write when learning C++ conditionals.

## How to Run

1. Open your C++ IDE (e.g., Dev-C++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
2. Open the `exampasschk.cpp` file.
3. Click **Run** or **Build and Run**.
4. Enter a score when prompted.
5. The program will display the score and indicate whether the student passed or failed.
