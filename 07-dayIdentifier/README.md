# Day Identifier in C++

This is a simple C++ program that displays the name of the day based on a number entered by the user (1 to 7).  
It's typically one of the first programs beginners write when learning C++ conditionals and switch statements.

## How to Run

1. Open your C++ IDE (e.g., Dev-C++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
2. Open the `DayIdentifier.cpp` file.
3. Click **Run** or **Build and Run**.
4. Enter a number between 1 and 7 when prompted.
5. The program will display the corresponding day name or an error message if the number is invalid.
