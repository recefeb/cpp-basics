# Letter Type Checker in C++

This is a simple C++ program that determines whether the entered character is a vowel or a consonant.  
It's typically one of the first programs beginners write when learning C++ conditionals and switch statements.

## How to Run

1. Open your C++ IDE (e.g., Dev-C++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
2. Open the `lettertypechecker.cpp` file.
3. Click **Run** or **Build and Run**.
4. Enter a single letter when prompted.
5. The program will display whether the letter is a vowel or a consonant, or indicate if the input is not a valid letter.
