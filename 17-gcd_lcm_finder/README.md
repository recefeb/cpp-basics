# GCD and LCM Calculator

A simple C++ program that takes two integers and calculates their GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple).

## 🧩 Purpose
The program determines:
- The largest common divisor of the two numbers (GCD)
- The smallest common multiple of the two numbers (LCM)

It uses a basic divisor-search loop and the formula:
LCM = (a * b) / GCD

## 🚀 How to Run

### Compile
g++ gcd_lcm_finder.cpp -o gcd_lcm_finder

### Execute
./gcd_lcm_finder

Example:
Input → 12 18  
Output → GCD = 6, LCM = 36
