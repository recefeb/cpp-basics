# Month Days Checker in C++

This is a simple C++ program that displays the number of days in a month based on the number entered by the user (1 to 12).  
It's typically one of the first programs beginners write when learning C++ conditionals and switch statements.

## How to Run

1. Open your C++ IDE (e.g., Dev-C++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
2. Open the `MonthDaysChecker.cpp` file.
3. Click **Run** or **Build and Run**.
4. Enter a number between 1 and 12 when prompted.
5. The program will display the number of days in the corresponding month or indicate if the input is invalid.
