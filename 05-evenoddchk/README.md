# Even or Odd Check in C++

This is a simple C++ program that checks whether a number entered by the user is even or odd.  
It's typically one of the first programs beginners write when learning C++ conditionals and arithmetic operations.

## How to Run

1. Open your C++ IDE (e.g., Dev-C++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
2. Open the `evenoddchk.cpp` file.
3. Click **Run** or **Build and Run**.
4. Enter a number when prompted.
5. The program will display whether the number is even or odd.
